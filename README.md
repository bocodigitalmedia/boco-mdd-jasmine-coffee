# Mather

Mather is a library for doing Math.

    Mather = require "mather"
    mather = new Mather

## Adding numbers

It adds two numbers:

    mather.add 2, 2, (error, result) ->
      throw error if error?
      expect(result).toEqual 4
      ok()

It adds more than two numbers:

    mather.add 3, 4, 5, (error, result) ->
      throw error if error?
      expect(result).toEqual 12
      ok()
```

```coffee
# file: "example.spec.coffee"
$files = null

describe "Mather", ->
  [Mather, mather] = []

  beforeEach ->
    Mather = require "mather"
    mather = new Mather

  describe "Adding numbers", ->

    it "It adds two numbers:", (ok) ->
      mather.add 2, 2, (error, result) ->
        throw error if error?
        expect(result).toEqual 4
        ok()

    it "It adds more than two numbers:", (ok) ->
      mather.add 3, 4, 5, (error, result) ->
        throw error if error?
        expect(result).toEqual 12
        ok()
```
